### Background and Dataset
Modern lending is  increasingly relying on automated systems to evaluate borrowers and assess risk levels. Using LendingClub’s dataset I perform an exploratory analysis and run it through a logistic regression model to assess if we can use results to predict the likeliness of loan default, and creating a subsequent scorecard to assess borrowers based on the model's results.

I am going to explore the dataset which includes over 1.3 million loan files and over 100 variables which include:
 - Basic borrower information (brief demographics)
 - Borrower credit history (credit score, income, debts, open accounts, etc.)
 - Loan information (terms, rates, payments, etc.)
 - Loan performance (status, i.e. collections, default, PIF)

### Problem Statement
Given a predefined set of borrower credit history and characteristics, can we separate low risk from high risk borrowers and ultimately predict if a borrower will have trouble paying back a loan?

### Hypothesis
I think that employing a classification learner such as logistic regression or random forests, we’ll be able to classify a loan into a binary category, ultimately extracting features that predict loan performance from a predefined set of loan application features.

### Exploring the Features
Within LendingClub’s website you can select as many features as you want to assess a borrowers application. In this project I select certain features and clean the dataset, followed by several charts to visualize thei features.
